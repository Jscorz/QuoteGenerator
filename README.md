## **How It's Made:**

This project was a fairly simple build process. First thing was connecting to the API that supplies the quotes for consumption. After that displayed data correctly, I used the useState hook to control the current quote and to switch to a new one when the button is pressed. I used styled components to write the CSS to style the application. Then just added minor animations for the next button.

## **Tech used:**

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS, Styled components

## **Lesson's learned:**

I already knew how to do everything I could learn out of the app, but just wanted a quote generator and something to practice interacting with API's some more.
